# Post-disaster-response Application
Design & Develop an application related to post disaster response, the business idea is to
bridge the gap between those who can provide help (clothes, food packets, medical
consultation, medical apparatus, medicines) and those who need help.
Providers (those who can provide help) can,
1) register themselves on portal
2) after successful registration, can login as supplier
3) after logging in, they can fill a form for the service they can help with mentioning
appropriate details such as service they can offer, and area of operation etc.
4) view my services page where they can view services they have filled form for and see details
of receiver they are allocated to help
Receivers (Consumers) can post request for clothes, food packets, medical consultation,
medical apparatus, medicines etc. They can request for all these services via portal. They can
1) register themselves with contact details, address
2) after registration, they can login
3) after login, they can raise an appropriate request through the portal
4) view my requests page where they can view their requests and see if a service provider has
been allocated to fulfil that request
Application should automatically assign the request to a provider according to the
availability, and area of operation. For fulling this purpose, you can use schedulers in Spring
Boot.
